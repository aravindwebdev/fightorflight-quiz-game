Fight or Flight Quiz Game Using HTML, CSS and Javascript

To create a high-energy, interactive Table Topics web app that blends pressure-based decision-making with dramatic storytelling—designed to engage Toastmasters in fast thinking, ethical reflection, and spontaneous speech delivery.
This web-based Table Topics game simulates high-stakes scenarios inspired by Squid Game and philosophical dilemmas. Speakers are randomly selected via a spinning wheel and given bold prompts with two choices: Fight or Flight. Each decision triggers a twist they must respond to within a countdown timer. The app includes:
- 🎡 Animated name spinner with no repeats
- 💬 Prompt cards with bold, non-repeating questions
- ⏱️ Digital countdown timer
- 🟥🟩 Fight/Flight buttons styled like Red Light/Green Light
- 🎲 Bonus Round: Trolley Problem page with ethical choices
Perfect for online club meetings, contests, or themed sessions that push speakers out of their comfort zone and into the spotlight.
